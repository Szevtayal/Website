            <p>“We believe in nurturing  our brimming students by making them learn , imagine, explore , play and enjoy “ . Keeping this very thought in our mind, Team MIS organised a  "Drive Thru" 

The theme of the programme was "Welcome to the World of Unicorn".
The event was  specially organised to welcome our Nursery class students as they visited the school the very first time and to give them a feeling of going to the school. Balloons and welcome cards were given to our special guests i.e.tiny tots of Nursery. It  was an immense pleasure for the little ones as they had enjoyed the "Drive Thru"with their parents. The school surroundings were beautifully decorated with balloons and unicorn theme . There were game stalls for them. Also there was a hungry point where they were given muffins. They also got  beautiful gift hampers designed specially for them by the teachers. There were different spots of photography. Father’s day selfie corner was the centre of attraction. Proper social distancing was maintained, taking into consideration the ongoing pandemic situation. 
 At the exit point, holidays homework was also given to all the tiny tots. Parents really appreciated the hard work and efforts of the teachers. 
To conclude, the whole programme was a huge success and the compliment section was full of beautiful compliments by our worthy parents of kindergarten section.
Special thanks to team members for their performance and to Principal Ms .Daljit Kaur for organising this "Drive Thru" event which was unique and highly appreciated by parents and kids.
